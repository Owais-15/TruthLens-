# Next Steps: GitHub & Cloud Deployment

## ✅ Completed
- Database setup on Neon
- Migrations applied successfully
- Git repository initialized
- Code committed locally

## 🚀 Next: Create GitHub Repository

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `truthlens` (or your preferred name)
3. Description: "AI-powered hallucination detection and fact verification system"
4. **Keep it Private** (recommended) or Public
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Push Code to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Run these in your terminal:

```bash
cd C:\Users\Admin\OneDrive\Documents\FInal_year_project

# Add GitHub as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/truthlens.git

# Push code
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Let me know when you've created the GitHub repository and I'll help you with the Render and Vercel deployment!** 🎯

## What's Next After GitHub

Once your code is on GitHub, we'll:
1. **Deploy Backend to Render** (5 minutes)
2. **Deploy Frontend to Vercel** (3 minutes)  
3. **Connect them together** (2 minutes)
4. **Test your live app!** 🎉

Total time: ~10 minutes to go live!
